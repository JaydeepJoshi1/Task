This television is a table model and is designed to sit on a firm, flat surface. Do not place the TV on soft carpeting or on a similar surface as this may cause the ventilation slots located on the bottom of the unit to be blocked and may result in reduced product lifespan from overheating To assure adequate ventilation for this product, maintain a spacing of one (1) inch from the top and side of the TV receiver and two (2) inches from the rear of the TV receiver and other surfaces.

Make sure the TV stand or base you use is of adequate size and strength to prevent the TV from being accidentally tipped over, pushed o, or pulled o. This may cause personal injury and/or damage the TV. Refer to the Important Safety Instructions on the next page.

The Power button	on this TV and your remote control puts the TV into a very low-power standby mode but will not completely turn the power off. In order to completely shut the power off, you will need to disconnect the power cord from the outlet. The mains plug/appliance coupler is used to completely turn off the device. If you prefer to completely turn off the device, you should install the TV in a manner that allows you to disconnect the power cord when desired.
